Integration tests — end-to-end pipeline (STEP 1.C3)

NOTE: Tests for Step 1.C3 are centralized in test_pipeline.py with detailed
TODO specifications. This file is intentionally kept as a stub for future
extended integration test scenarios beyond the core pipeline.

See docs/TODO_1C3_integration_test_e2e.md for full task specification.
See tests/test_pipeline.py for actual test implementations (1.C3-a through 1.C3-h).
