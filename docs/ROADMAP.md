# DoD Budget Analysis — Project Roadmap

> **Objective:** Build a public, web-facing, user-queryable database of Department of Defense budget data that allows users to filter, explore, and download results.

This roadmap is organized into four phases. Every task has a reference ID (e.g., **Step 1.A1**) so individual items can be tracked, assigned, and discussed in issues and pull requests.

---

## Phase 0 - Project Description and Creation of Documentation

**Goal:** Create a clear outline of the project and how to use it such that other parties can contribute to the development and/or easily use the results.

### 0.A — Phase 0 Tasks
| ID | Task | Details | Status |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| **0.A1** | Merge ROADMAP into README | Merge ROADMAP into README for clarity in the path forward for the project | **Complete** |
| **0.A2** | Create Wiki Skeleton | Create skeleton of wiki pages for completion as supsequent phases and tasks complete | **Complete** |

---

## Phase 1 — Data Extraction & Normalization

**Goal:** Reliably download every relevant DoD budget document and transform it into clean, structured, machine-readable data.

### 1.A — Source Coverage & Download Pipeline

| ID | Task | Details | Status |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| **1.A1** | Audit existing downloader coverage | Catalog every source the current `dod_budget_downloader.py` supports (Comptroller, Defense-Wide, Army, Navy/USMC, Air Force/Space Force). Identify gaps — e.g., Defense Logistics Agency, MDA standalone exhibits, or SOCOM. | ✅ Partially Complete — 5 main sources implemented; additional sources identified but not added. Remaining: network audit needed (TODO 1.A1-a/b/c) |
| **1.A2** | Expand fiscal-year coverage | Ensure the downloader can discover and retrieve documents for all publicly available fiscal years (currently dynamic discovery works for recent years; verify historical reach back to at least FY2017). | 🔄 In Progress — FY2025-2026 confirmed; historical reach needs network verification (TODO 1.A2-a/b/c) |
| **1.A3** | Harden download reliability | Improve retry logic, handle WAF/CAPTCHA changes on government sites, add checksum or size verification for downloaded files, and implement a manifest of expected vs. actual downloads. | ✅ Partially Complete — Smart file skipping, 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff, WAF/bot detection helper; hash verification stub remaining |
| **1.A4** | Automate download scheduling | Create a repeatable, scriptable download pipeline (CLI-only, no GUI dependency) that can be run via cron or CI to keep data current when new fiscal-year documents are published. | ✅ **Complete** — CLI `--no-gui` mode, `scripts/scheduled_download.py` orchestrator with dry-run support |
| **1.A5** | Document all data sources | Create a data sources reference listing every URL pattern, document type, file format, and fiscal-year availability for each service and agency. | 🔄 In Progress — `docs/user-guide/data-sources.md` exists; coverage matrix needs live audit (depends on 1.A1) |
| **1.A6** | Retry failed downloads | Write a structured failure log (`failed_downloads.json`) with URL, dest path, and browser flag for each failed file. Add a `--retry-failures` CLI flag that reads the log and re-attempts only those files. Update the GUI completion dialog to show failure URLs and a copy-retry-command button. | ⚠️ Not started |

### 1.B — Parsing & Normalization

| ID | Task | Details | Status |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| **1.B1** | Catalog all exhibit types | Enumerate every exhibit type encountered (P-1, R-1, O-1, M-1, C-1, P-5, R-2, R-3, R-4, etc.) and document the column layout and semantics for each. | ✅ Mostly Complete — `exhibit_catalog.py` (429 lines) defines column layouts for P-1, P-5, R-1, R-2, O-1, M-1, C-1, P-1R, RF-1 with `ExhibitCatalog` class; `scripts/exhibit_audit.py` scans corpus; remaining: inventory against downloaded files (needs corpus) |
| **1.B2** | Standardize column mappings | Extend `build_budget_db.py` column-mapping logic to handle all known exhibit formats consistently; add unit tests for each exhibit type with sample data. | ✅ Mostly Complete — Data-driven catalog approach implemented in `exhibit_catalog.py`; `_map_columns()`, `_merge_header_rows()`, catalog-driven detection all tested; multi-row header handling implemented |
| **1.B3** | Normalize monetary values | Ensure all dollar amounts use a consistent unit (thousands of dollars), currency-year label, and handle the distinction between Budget Authority (BA), Appropriations, and Outlays. | 🔄 In Progress — FY2024-2026 columns supported with `_safe_float()` normalization; `amount_type` field tracks BA vs appropriation; full currency-year labeling TODO |
| **1.B4** | Extract and normalize program element (PE) and line-item metadata | Parse PE numbers, line-item numbers, budget activity codes, appropriation titles, and sub-activity groups into dedicated, queryable fields. | ✅ Mostly Complete — `pe_number`, `line_item`, `budget_activity_title`, `sub_activity_title`, `appropriation_code`, `appropriation_title` all extracted; regex patterns validated in `utils/patterns.py` |
| **1.B5** | PDF text extraction quality audit | Review `pdfplumber` output for the most common PDF layouts; identify tables that extract poorly and implement targeted extraction improvements or fallback strategies. | ✅ Mostly Complete — `scripts/pdf_quality_audit.py` (312 lines) implements automated audit; `utils/pdf_sections.py` handles R-2/R-3 narrative sections; remaining: targeted improvements for identified poor extractions |
| **1.B6** | Build validation suite | Create automated checks that flag anomalies: missing fiscal years for a service, duplicate rows, zero-sum line items, column misalignment, and unexpected exhibit formats. | ✅ **Complete** — `validate_budget_db.py` (522 lines) + `utils/validation.py` (255 lines) with `ValidationRegistry`, 10+ checks, and cross-service/cross-exhibit reconciliation in `scripts/reconcile_budget_data.py` |

### 1.C — Data Pipeline Testing

| ID | Task | Details | Status |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| **1.C1** | Create representative test fixtures | Assemble a small set of real (or redacted) Excel and PDF files covering each exhibit type and each service to use in automated tests. | ✅ **Complete** — `scripts/generate_expected_output.py` creates synthetic .xlsx fixtures + expected JSON; 14 integration tests in `tests/test_fixture_integration.py`; fixtures for P-1, P-5, R-1, R-2, O-1, M-1, C-1 |
| **1.C2** | Unit tests for parsing logic | Write `pytest` tests for column detection, value normalization, exhibit-type identification, and PE/line-item extraction. | ✅ **Complete** — 1183 tests across 49 test files covering all parsing modules: `_detect_exhibit_type`, `_map_columns`, `_safe_float`, `_determine_category`, `_extract_table_text`, regex patterns, string utilities, config classes, and more |
| **1.C3** | Integration test: end-to-end pipeline | Test the full flow from raw files → SQLite database → search query, verifying row counts and known values. | ✅ **Complete** — `test_e2e_pipeline.py` + `test_fixture_integration.py` (14 tests) + API endpoint integration tests (`test_budget_lines_endpoint.py`, `test_search_endpoint.py`) |

## Recent Improvements

### Round 5 — Database Data Quality Fixes (2026-02-27)

Ran a 9-step migration (`scripts/fix_data_quality.py`) and hardened the ingestion
pipeline to eliminate duplicates, fill NULL fields, and clean reference tables.

| Change | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Cross-file deduplication (`pipeline/builder.py` + migration) | 124,670 rows to 47,531 (62% reduction) |
| Appropriation code backfill (`repair_database.py`) | NULL appropriation_code: 17.5% to 7.4% |
| Budget type expansion (`scripts/fix_budget_types.py`) | NULL budget_type: 388 to 116 |
| Organization name fill (migration step 5) | Empty organization_name: 311 to 0 |
| Footnote cleanup (`pipeline/backfill.py`) | Reference table footnotes: 31 to 0 |
| `*a.xlsx` exclusion in builder | Prevents amendment file duplicates at ingestion |

**New files:** `scripts/fix_data_quality.py`, `tests/test_pipeline_group/test_data_quality_fixes.py` (34 tests)

**Modified:** `pipeline/builder.py`, `repair_database.py`, `scripts/fix_budget_types.py`, `pipeline/backfill.py`
